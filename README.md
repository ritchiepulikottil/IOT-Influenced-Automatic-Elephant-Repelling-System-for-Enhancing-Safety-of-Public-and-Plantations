# IOT-Influenced-Automatic-Elephant-Repelling-System-for-Enhancing-Safety-of-Public-and-Plantations
Majority of the forest areas are getting destroyed, due to human population explosion and deforestation thereby causing Human- Animal Conflict. This has also resulted in tremendous agricultural losses. The proposed will be focusing mainly upon elephants rather than other animals in the wilderness. Currently Elephant identification are being done using CCTV, LVDT, etc. But these methods are very expensive and less accurate. The work in hand is an automated system for the identification of wild elephants and repel them back into their forest. The sensors are placed in two layers so as to track the presence of animals with greater accuracy. The first primary layer senses the movement of the animal in the vicinity. This is aided by InfraRed sensors/PIR sensors/ Sharp IR sensors. The next layer senses and confirms the vibrations of the elephant with the help of piezoelectric vibration sensor/seismic sensors and also helps in repelling the wild elephants back into the forest. As soon as the second layer confirms the intrusion of wild elephants, it sends alert signals to the base station using a GSM Module thereby alerting the concerned authorities to take necessary actions.
